Flag definitions for lithology and hydrostratigraphy. 

In all cases we give suggestions for how to fix the problem. However, if you 
believe that the record is correct, but that the *flag* is incorrect, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/bcgov/bcaquiferdata/issues) and let us
know what the problem is (which flag is incorrect and why) 
and with which Well (`well_tag_number`).

You can access this list in R at any time through the `flags` dataset.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
gt::gt(bcaquiferdata::flags) |>
  gt::tab_style(gt::cell_text(font = "monospace"),
                gt::cells_body(columns = "Flag"))
    
```

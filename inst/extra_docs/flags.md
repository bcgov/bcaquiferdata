Flag definitions for lithology and hydrostratigraphy. 

In all cases we give suggestions for how to fix the problem. However, if you 
believe that the record is correct, but that the *flag* is incorrect, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/bcgov/bcaquiferdata/issues) and let us
know what the problem is (which flag is incorrect and why) 
and with which Well (`well_tag_number`).

You can access this list in R at any time through the `flags` dataset.

Many of these refer to `from` and `to` fields which are the `lithology_from_ft_bgl`/`lithology_to_ft_bgl` and `lithology_from_m`/`lithology_to_m`.
